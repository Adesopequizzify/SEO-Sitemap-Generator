# Website Sitemap Generator

This is a simple shell script to generate a sitemap for a website in XML format. The sitemap can be submitted to search engines to improve SEO indexing.

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell
- Curl command-line tool (usually pre-installed on most systems)

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the `site.sh` script.

3. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x site.sh
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./site.sh
   ```

5. The script will prompt you to enter the website URL in the form of `http`. For example:

   ```bash
   Enter the website URL (in the form of http): https://www.example.com
   ```

   Make sure to provide the complete URL, including the protocol (`http` or `https`).

6. The script will attempt to generate the sitemap by checking if the website provides a `sitemap.xml` file. If the file is found, it will use the URLs from the sitemap. If not, the script will fall back to crawling the website and extracting URLs from its content.

7. After the process is complete, the script will generate an XML sitemap file named `sitemap.xml` in the same directory. You can submit this sitemap to search engines to improve SEO indexing.

## Example

Let's generate a sitemap for the website `https://www.example.com`:

```bash
./site.sh
```

You will be prompted to enter the website URL. After providing the URL, the script will generate the sitemap and save it as `sitemap.xml`.

Remember to replace `https://www.example.com` with the actual URL of the website you want to generate a sitemap for.

## Note

- This script may not work perfectly for all websites, especially those with complex JavaScript-based navigation. It's recommended to manually review the generated sitemap and make any necessary adjustments before submission to search engines.
- Always ensure that you have the necessary permissions to crawl and generate a sitemap for the website you are targeting.
